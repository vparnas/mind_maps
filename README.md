# mind_maps

Latex mind map experiments based on past course material and novels read. Note, these mind maps don't really respect the fundamentals of the technique. They serve for experimental purposes as well as a method to revise the scope of the material, but not necessarily as an ideal memory aid. And beyond the problematic nature of the content, mind maps serve best when produced by hand.
